By 1947 he abandoned representational imagery entirely and began working with color, light, and space. <em>Number 19</em> follows the characteristic format of his multiform paintings, in which loosely defined organic shapes hover over a thinly brushed background. Whereas color once assumed a supporting role in his compositions, by this period, color had become a defining force, thus marking the transition from Rothko\u2019s early work to his mature, color-field paintings.</p>\n",

In the summer of 1906, the artist traveled to the Catalan village of G\u00f3sol; upon his return to Paris that autumn, he painted <em>Half-Length Female Nude</em>. In stark contrast to the gaunt visage of <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/28067/the-old-guitarist\"><em>The Old Guitarist</em></a>, the angular, masklike qualities of the figure\u2019s face reveal Picasso\u2019s growing interest in ancient Iberian sculpture and non-Western art. In this way, the work anticipates his breakthrough to Cubism in 1907.</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>Consistent with the Impressionist aesthetic that Berthe Morisot fervently espoused, <em>Woman at Her Toilette</em> attempts to capture the essence of modern life in summary, understated terms. The painting also moves discreetly into the realm of female eroticism explored by Edgar Degas, \u00c9douard Manet, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir but seldom broached at this time by women artists. Rendered with soft, feathery brushstrokes in nuanced shades of lavender, pink, blue, white, and gray, the composition resembles a visual tone poem, orchestrated with such perfumed and rarified motifs as brushed blonde hair, satins, powder puffs, and \ufb02ower petals. The artist even signed her name along the bottom of the mirror, as if to suggest that the image in her painting is as ephemeral as a silvery re\ufb02ection. Morisot exhibited in seven of the eight Impressionist group shows; this painting was included in the fifth exhibition, in 1880, where her work received great acclaim. She was a particularly close friend of and frequent model for Manet, and she married his younger brother Eug\u00e8ne the year before she completed this painting. In addition to domestic interiors such as this one, Morisot\u2019s pictorial realm included studies of women and children, gardens, fields, and seaside vacation homes.</p>\n",

As a result of its unusual cropping and tilted perspective, it seems to capture an unedited glimpse of the interior of a small nineteenth-century millinery shop. The identity of the young woman in the painting remains unclear: she may be a shop girl or a customer. In an early version of the composition, the woman is clearly intended to be a customer; she wears a fashionable dress, though her hat\u2014a prerequisite token of bourgeois culture\u2014is absent. In the final painting, however, the woman appears with her mouth pursed, as if around a pin, and her hands gloved, possibly to protect the delicate fabric of the hat she holds. Degas seems to have deliberately left her role as a creator or consumer ambiguous. She is totally absorbed in her activity and, like most of the women in Degas\u2019s paintings, seems unaware of being watched. The bonnets that are displayed on the table next to her like a still life present an analogy to the artist\u2019s creative process: where they are unfinished, so too is the painting.</p>\n",

It shows men and boys on the bank of the Seine River in the working-class Parisian suburb of Asni\u00e8res. The view presented here is just across the river from the leisure park Seurat immortalized in his best-known work, <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/27992/a-sunday-on-la-grande-jatte-1884\"><em>A Sunday on La Grande Jatte\u20141884</em></a>. The frozen gestures and sedate poses of these bathers set a mood distinct from the sparkling scenes of Parisians enjoying <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/81555/lunch-at-the-restaurant-fournaise-the-rowers-lunch\">restaurants</a> and other <a href=\"https://www.artic.edu/artworks/95654/near-the-lake\">riverbank activities</a> favored by the Impressionists. Nevertheless, Seurat\u2019s focus on a subject from modern life, his luminous palette, and his airy brushwork show how the young artist adapted characteristics of Impressionist painting for his own purposes.</p>\n",

      "description": "<p>Marc Chagall had a prolific career that spanned more than eight decades of the twentieth century. While his work often exhibits influences of the contemporary movements he encountered in France and Germany, his subjects and decorative lyricism reveal his love of Russian folk art and his roots in Hasidic Judaism.</p>\n<p>In his 1931 autobiography, <em>My Life</em>, Chagall related how, while visiting Vitebsk (present-day Belarus), the city in which he was born, he realized that the traditions in which he had grown up were fast disappearing and that he needed to document them. He paid a man to pose in his father\u2019s prayer clothes and then painted him, limiting his palette primarily to black and white, as befit the solemnity of the subject. This portrait is noteworthy for the simplicity of its execution; nonetheless, its striking patterns, abstract background, and the slightly distorted features of the model demonstrate Chagall\u2019s absorption of modern trends, especially Cubism.</p>\n<p>Chagall often painted variants or replicas of works he particularly loved. The Art Institute\u2019s <em>Praying Jew</em> is one of three versions of this composition. He painted the original canvas in 1914, and when he traveled back to Paris in 1923, he took this painting with him. He learned upon his return that much of the work he had left in France had been lost during World War I. This prompted him to make two versions of <em>The Praying Jew</em> before it left his studio: they are the present work and another in the Ca\u2019 Pesaro, Venice; the original is now in the Kunstmuseum, Basel. The later compositions differ from the original only in small details.</p>\n",

Just four years earlier, architect William Hartmann of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill had approached Pablo Picasso with the commission. The artist accepted and crafted two steel maquettes; he kept one in his studio and gave the other to the architect to use in planning.
